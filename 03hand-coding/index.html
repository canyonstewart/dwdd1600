             <h2>A Quote that Inspires Me</h2>
             <p>“We'd like to be painters, we'd like to be poets. We'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows we can't earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that. and uhm, forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time</p>
             <p>You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don't like doing, which is stupid!</p>
             <p>It is absolutely stupid!</p>
             <p>Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you're doing, it doesn't matter what it is – somebody is interested in everything, anything you can be interested in, you will find others will</p>
             <p>But it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like, and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See what we are doing, is we're bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lives we are living. In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing, so it's all retch, and no vomit it never gets there. Therefore, it's so important to consider this question: What do I desire?” – Alan Watts</p>
